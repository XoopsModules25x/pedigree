TODO (suggested by Zyspec):

- move CheckoutWizard class to ./class
- move ZervWizard classes to ./library
- move hard coded language strings to language files
- some code assumes "dog" but should be expanded to include all animals
- refactor Pedigree\Field::getForm() - it tries to use XoopsObjectTree which isn't
  appropriate for the pedigree_fields dB structure
- most text fields are only 30 chars long in dB, should be increased.
- Make form entry fields match dB varchar length so users can know what's being stored.
- rewrite Waiting module plugin - currently doesn't work
